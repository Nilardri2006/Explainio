# Explainio - Explainable AI for Transparent Decision-Making

## 🚀 Overview
AI decisions are often mysterious and untrustworthy. **Explainio** is an **Explainable AI (XAI) framework** designed to address this issue by making AI-driven decisions **transparent, interpretable, and trustworthy**. Whether it's approving a loan, diagnosing a disease, or making critical predictions, Explainio ensures that users understand **exactly why AI made a particular decision**.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Justification Engine** 🏗️ - Provides clear, human-readable explanations for AI outputs.
- **Glass-Box Models** 🔍 - Uses decision trees, rule-based AI, and interpretable deep learning models.
- **SHAP & LIME Integration** 📊 - Generates feature importance explanations to clarify decision-making.
- **Audit Logs** 📝 - Tracks decisions for compliance, debugging, and trust-building.
- **Customizable Transparency Levels** ⚙️ - Users can control the level of detail in AI explanations.
- **Bias Detection & Mitigation** ⚖️ - Ensures fairer AI outcomes by identifying and reducing biases.

## 🎯 Use Cases
✅ **Finance** - AI-powered loan approvals with clear risk assessments.  
✅ **Healthcare** - Explainable AI-based disease diagnosis for better trust in medical decisions.  
✅ **HR & Recruitment** - AI-driven hiring decisions with justifications for fairness.  
✅ **Legal & Compliance** - AI decisions meet ethical and regulatory standards.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **AI Framework**: NVIDIA Groot AI  
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript  
- **Libraries**: SHAP, LIME, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NVIDIA Groot  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **Frameworks**: Flask / FastAPI (Backend), React (Frontend)  
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP  

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankit2061/Explainio.git
cd Explainio
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **AI makes a prediction** (e.g., "Loan Rejected").  
2. **Explainio generates a justification** (e.g., "Income below threshold, high debt-to-income ratio").  
3. **User receives a transparent explanation** and can request further details.  
4. **System logs the decision** for future audits and accountability.  

## 🏗️ Roadmap
- [ ] Implement a user-friendly dashboard for explanations.  
- [ ] Support additional XAI techniques (e.g., Counterfactuals, Anchors).  
- [ ] Improve bias detection and mitigation mechanisms.
