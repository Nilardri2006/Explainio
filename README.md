# Explainio - Explainable AI for Transparent Decision-Making

## 🚀 Overview
XplaiN is an *Explainable AI (XAI) framework* designed to make AI-driven decisions *transparent, interpretable, and trustworthy. Whether it's approving a loan, diagnosing a disease, or making critical predictions, XplaiN ensures that users understand the *"why" behind AI decisions**.

## 🔥 Key Features
•⁠  ⁠*Justification Engine* 🏗️ - Provides clear, human-readable explanations for AI outputs.
•⁠  ⁠*Glass-Box Models* 🔍 - Uses decision trees, rule-based AI, and interpretable deep learning models.
•⁠  ⁠*SHAP & LIME Integration* 📊 - Generates feature importance explanations.
•⁠  ⁠*Audit Logs* 📝 - Keeps track of decisions for compliance and debugging.
•⁠  ⁠*Customizable Transparency Levels* ⚙️ - Choose how much detail to show users.
•⁠  ⁠*Bias Detection* ⚖️ - Identifies and mitigates AI biases for fairer outcomes.

## 🎯 Use Cases
✅ *Finance* - Loan approvals with explainable risk assessments.
✅ *Healthcare* - Transparent AI-based disease diagnosis.
✅ *HR & Recruitment* - Fair AI-driven hiring decisions.
✅ *Legal & Compliance* - Ensuring AI decisions meet ethical standards.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
•⁠  ⁠*Programming Languages*: Python, JavaScript
•⁠  ⁠*Libraries*: SHAP, LIME, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
•⁠  ⁠*Database*: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
•⁠  ⁠*Frameworks*: Flask / FastAPI (Backend), React (Frontend)
•⁠  ⁠*Deployment*: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
⁠ bash
git clone https://github.com/ankit2061/Explainio.git
cd Explainio
 ⁠

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
⁠ bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ⁠

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
⁠ bash
python app.py
 ⁠

## 🧠 How It Works
1.⁠ ⁠*AI makes a prediction* (e.g., "Loan Rejected").
2.⁠ ⁠*XplaiN generates an explanation* (e.g., "Income below threshold, high debt-to-income ratio").
3.⁠ ⁠*User sees clear justifications* and can request further details.
4.⁠ ⁠*System logs decision* for future audits.

## 🏗️ Roadmap
•⁠  ⁠[ ] Implement a user-friendly dashboard for explanations.
•⁠  ⁠[ ] Support additional XAI techniques (e.g., Counterfactuals, Anchors).
•⁠  ⁠[ ] Improve bias detection and mitigation.
